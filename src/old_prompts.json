A field mask specifying one or more data types is required. Nearby Search (New) only supports POST requests.\n\nThe API Explorer lets you make live requests so that you can get familiar with the API and the API options:\n\n[Try it!](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/nearby-search#try-it)\n\nTry the [interactive demo](https://places-search-405409.ue.r.appspot.com/) to see Nearby Search (New) results displayed on a map.\n\n## Nearby Search (New) requests\n\nA Nearby Search (New) request is an HTTP POST request to a URL in the form:\n\nhttps://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchNearby  \n\nPass all parameters in the JSON request body or in headers as part of the POST request. For example:\n\ncurl -X POST -d **'{\n  \"includedTypes\": [\"restaurant\"],\n  \"maxResultCount\": 10,\n  \"locationRestriction\": {\n    \"circle\": {\n      \"center\": {\n        \"latitude\": 37.7937,\n        \"longitude\": -122.3965},\n      \"radius\": 500.0\n    }\n  }\n}'** -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H \"X-Goog-Api-Key: API_KEY\n\n\" -H \"X-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName\" https://places.googleapis.com/v1/places:searchNearby\n\n## Nearby Search (New) responses\n\nNearby Search (New) returns a [JSON object as a response](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places/searchNearby#response-body). In the response:\n\n- The `places` array contains all matching places.\n- Each place in the array is represented by a [`Place`](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/reference/rest/v1/places) object. The `Place` object contains detailed information about a single place.\n- The [FieldMask](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/nearby-search#fieldmask) passed in the request specifies the list of fields returned in the `Place` object.\n\nThe complete JSON object is in the form:\n\n{\u00a0 \"places\": [\u00a0 \u00a0 {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 object (Place)\u00a0 \u00a0 }\u00a0 ]  \n}  \n\n## Required parameters\n\n- ### FieldMask\n    \n\nSpecify the list of fields to return in the response by creating a [response field mask](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/choose-fields). Pass the response field mask to the method by using the URL parameter `$fields` or `fields`, or by using the HTTP header `X-Goog-FieldMask`. There is no default list of returned fields in the response. If you omit the field mask, the method returns an error.\n\nField masking is a good design practice to ensure that you don't request unnecessary data, which helps to avoid unnecessary processing time and billing charges.\n\nSpecify a comma-separated list of place data types to return. For example, to retrieve the display name and the address of the place.\n\nX-Goog-FieldMask: places.displayName,places.formattedAddress\n\n**Note:** Spaces are not allowed anywhere in the field list.\n\nUse `*` to retrieve all fields.\n\n- X-Goog-FieldMask: *\n    \n    Wildcard \"*\" selects all fields. However, while that wildcard is fine to use in development, Google discourage the use of the wildcard (*) response field mask in production because of the large amount of data that can be returned.\n    \n    Further guidance for using `places.iconMaskBaseUri` and `places.iconBackgroundColor` can be found in [Place Icons](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/icons) section.\n    \n    Specify one or more of the following fields:\n    \n    - The following fields trigger the [Nearby Search (Basic) SKU](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing#basic-nearbysearch):\n        \n        `places.accessibilityOptions`, `places.addressComponents`, `places.adrFormatAddress`, `places.attributions`, `places.businessStatus`, `places.displayName`, `places.formattedAddress`, `places.googleMapsUri`, `places.iconBackgroundColor`, `places.iconMaskBaseUri`, `places.id`, `places.location`, `places.name`*, `places.photos`, `places.plusCode`, `places.primaryType`, `places.primaryTypeDisplayName`, `places.shortFormattedAddress`, `places.subDestinations`, `places.types`, `places.utcOffsetMinutes`, `places.viewport`  \n          \n        * The `places.name` field contains the place _resource name_ in the form: `places/PLACE_ID`. Use `places.displayName` to access the text name of the place.\n        \n    - The following fields trigger the [Nearby Search (Advanced) SKU](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing#advanced-nearbysearch):\n        \n        `places.currentOpeningHours`, `places.currentSecondaryOpeningHours`, `places.internationalPhoneNumber`, `places.nationalPhoneNumber`, `places.priceLevel`, `places.rating`, `places.regularOpeningHours`, `places.regularSecondaryOpeningHours`, `places.userRatingCount`, `places.websiteUri`\n        \n    - The following fields trigger the [Nearby Search (Preferred) SKU](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/usage-and-billing#preferred-nearbysearch):\n        \n        `places.allowsDogs`, `places.curbsidePickup`, `places.delivery`, `places.dineIn`, `places.editorialSummary`, `places.evChargeOptions`, `places.fuelOptions`, `places.goodForChildren`, `places.goodForGroups`, `places.goodForWatchingSports`, `places.liveMusic`, `places.menuForChildren`, `places.parkingOptions`, `places.paymentOptions`, `places.outdoorSeating`, `places.reservable`, `places.restroom`, `places.reviews`, `places.servesBeer`, `places.servesBreakfast`, `places.servesBrunch`, `places.servesCocktails`, `places.servesCoffee`, `places.servesDesserts`, `places.servesDinner`, `places.servesLunch`, `places.servesVegetarianFood`, `places.servesWine`, `places.takeout`  \n        \n- ### locationRestriction\n    \n\nThe region to search specified as a circle, defined by center point and radius in meters. The radius must be between 0.0 and 50000.0, inclusive. The default radius is 0.0. You must set it in your request to a value greater than 0.0.\n\nFor example:\n\n- \"locationRestriction\": {\u00a0 \"circle\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \"center\": {\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"latitude\": 37.7937,\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \"longitude\": -122.3965\u00a0 \u00a0 },\u00a0 \u00a0 \"radius\": 500.0\u00a0 }  \n    }\n    \n\n## Optional parameters\n\n- ### includedTypes/excludedTypes, includedPrimaryTypes/excludedPrimaryTypes\n    \n\nLets you specify a list of types from types [Table A](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-a) used to filter the search results. Up to 50 types can be specified in each type restriction category.\n\n**Note:** The values in [Table B](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-b) are only returned in the response. You cannot use values in [Table B](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-b) as a filter.\n\nA place can only have a **single primary type** from types [Table A](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-a) associated with it. For example, the primary type might be `\"mexican_restaurant\"` or `\"steak_house\"`. Use `includedPrimaryTypes` and `excludedPrimaryTypes` to filter the results on a place's primary type.\n\nA place can also have **multiple type values** from types [Table A](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-a) associated with it. For example a restaurant might have the following types: `\"seafood_restaurant\"`, `\"restaurant\"`, `\"food\"`, `\"point_of_interest\"`, `\"establishment\"`. Use `includedTypes` and `excludedTypes` to filter the results on the list of types associated with a place.\n\nIf a search is specified with multiple type restrictions, only places that satisfy all of the restrictions are returned. For example, if you specify `{\"includedTypes\": [\"restaurant\"], \"excludedPrimaryTypes\": [\"steak_house\"]}`, the returned places provide `\"restaurant\"` related services but do not operate primarily as a `\"steak_house\"`.\n\nIf you omit `includedTypes`, `excludedTypes`, `includedPrimaryTypes`, and `excludedPrimaryTypes` from the request, the search returns places for all types from within the location restriction bounds.\n\n#### includedTypes\n\nA comma-separated list of the place types from [Table A](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-a) to search for. If this parameter is omitted, places of all types are returned.\n\n#### excludedTypes\n\nA comma-separated list of place types from [Table A](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-a) to exclude from a search.\n\nIf you specify both the `includedTypes` ( such as `\"school\"`) and the `excludedTypes` (such as `\"primary_school\"`) in the request, then the response includes places that are categorized as `\"school\"` but not as `\"primary_school\"`. The response includes places that match **at least one** of the `includedTypes` and **none of** the `excludedTypes`.\n\nIf there are any conflicting types, such as a type appearing in both `includedTypes` and `excludedTypes`, an `INVALID_REQUEST` error is returned.\n\n#### includedPrimaryTypes\n\nA comma-separated list of primary place types from [Table A](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-a) to include in a search.\n\n#### excludedPrimaryTypes\n\n- A comma-separated list of primary place types from [Table A](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-types#table-a) to exclude from a search.\n    \n    If there are any conflicting primary types, such as a type appearing in both `includedPrimaryTypes` and `excludedPrimaryTypes`, an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error is returned.\n    \n- ### languageCode\n    \n- The language in which to return results.\n    \n    - See the list of [supported languages](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport). Google often updates the supported languages, so this list may not be exhaustive.\n    - If `languageCode` is not supplied, the API defaults to `en`. If you specify an invalid language code, the API returns an `INVALID_ARGUMENT` error.\n    - The API does its best to provide a street address that is readable for both the user and locals. To achieve that goal, it returns street addresses in the local language, transliterated to a script readable by the user if necessary, observing the preferred language. All other addresses are returned in the preferred language. Address components are all returned in the same language, which is chosen from the first component.\n    - If a name is not available in the preferred language, the API uses the closest match.\n    - The preferred language has a small influence on the set of results that the API chooses to return, and the order in which they are returned. The geocoder interprets abbreviations differently depending on language, such as the abbreviations for street types, or synonyms that may be valid in one language but not in another.\n- ### maxResultCount\n    \n- Specifies the maximum number of place results to return. Must be between 1 and 20 (default) inclusive.\n    \n- ### rankPreference\n    \n- The type of ranking to use. If this parameter is omitted, results are ranked by popularity. May be one of the following:\n    \n    - `POPULARITY` (default) Sorts results based on their popularity.\n    - `DISTANCE` Sorts results in ascending order by their distance from the specified location.\n- ### regionCode\n    \n\n- The region code used to format the response, specified as a [two-character CLDR code](https://www.unicode.org/cldr/charts/latest/supplemental/territory_language_information.html) value. There is no default value.\n    \n    If the country name of the `formattedAddress` field in the response matches the `regionCode`, the country code is omitted from `formattedAddress`. This parameter has no effect on `adrFormatAddress`, which always includes the country name, or on `shortFormattedAddress`, which never includes it.\n    \n    Most CLDR codes are identical to ISO 3166-1 codes, with some notable exceptions. For example, the United Kingdom's ccTLD is \"uk\" (.co.uk) while its ISO 3166-1 code is \"gb\" (technically for the entity of \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\").
