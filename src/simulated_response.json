The Peking duck was the one we most enjoyed. You need to line up and get the item from the station handed to you by the staff, but they're pretty quick and will give you two portions or two pieces of duck on one wrap if you ask for it. The skin was crispy!\n\nLots of other items to choose from for lunch, including sushi rolls, western style breakfast (eggs, bacon, etc), lots of Chinese food (meats and veggies), dim sum, salads, fruit, lots of desserts and ice cream (I enjoyed the green tea flavour mousse cake and ice cream).\n\nI would be interested in coming back to try their dinner menu at some point.\n\nService was good and they're quick to clear your plates. Paying with cash will give you an 8% discount."

            "text": "This was a bit of a surprise. When Dragon Pearl first opened years ago, there was nothing like it. The atmosphere, the food, value for money was all top notch. In comparison the other all you can eat Chinese restaurant chain seemed stale and dated. You can tell the owner put a lot of thought and money into this place and building its reputation. Things have sadly changed.\nOne example is they used to have a soup station with a chef cutting freshly made noodles into this large cauldron. That beef soup was amazing! Over the years that chef became a quirky robot, hacking away at the noodles with a large chef knife. This was fun for to watch and the soup was still delicious. This time I went to that same area to get my soup and it just wasn’t there anymore. When I asked, one of the workers said “we don’t have that anymore, it wasn’t popular” That’s sad!\nOkay what about the rest of the food? There’s noticeably much less selection than ever!\nOkay well, how about the quality? Not near as good as it used to be. The Duck was dry and almost tasteless. The oyster was okay, I guess that’s why there was a lineup for them. The rest of the food I had was mediocre to just okay at best.\nMy whole party felt this way including a friend from mainland China who ended up just not eating much at all. (We hyped the buffet and she was genuinely excited to try it out)\nThis is so sad!\nI sincerely hope Dragon Perl becomes less complacent, adds more variety, and most importantly improves the quality of their food. Good restaurants need to be consistent and speaking of that older chain I mentioned in the beginning, that one is consistently good. The atmosphere isn’t nearly as nice as Dragon Pearl though. So sad!!"

They have 3 different types of oyster, raw, grilled garlic and mayo cheese. They have a good selection from the basics like fried rice to sashimi to charcuterie to peeking duck and more. The quality of the food was pretty good.\nHowever, the lines for oysters and peeking duck were extremely long. Their seating area is quite big but the area where you grab food is on the smaller side. So it was very packed. We went on a Thursday night and they actually ended up running out of oysters. Which was disappointing, they did end up giving some people including us a discount but it wasn’t given to everyone. We just got lucky as my friend went to the oyster station just as they ran out."

Dessert section is also pretty nice and has some Asian desserts like green tea/mango mousse cake, mango jelly and hot mango & taro sago.

For sure the servers were pretty busy, so I don't blame them, but, during our meal,we dropped a spoon, and asked for another one, but we never received it, shortly after we finished the water, asked for more and we ve been waiting 10+ minutes before we got a new bottle.\n\nWe had an issue with one of our dishes that somehow had an unwanted object that probably fell in during the cooking ( i  in a restaurant, so i know this kind of things can happen) in it.

The chicken and pork tacos were completely dry (probably from the warmer they keep them in). Salsa is extra, have never seen this before at any Mexican restaurant. Hot sauce caddy was placed on the table with regular hot sauces you can buy at any grocery store. Save this and provide salsa with the tacos. Drinks were good, and guacamole made table side was a nice touch. Service was below average, 10 min for anyone to touch the table, not attentive at all, often had to look for the server when we needed something."

Everyone liked their food, and decent portions.\n\nThe server was nice and came by often to check on us. A good place to hang out with friends, family or for couples.

Long story short - The reviews were very deserving!! Before I get into it, I will say that I have no idea what the names of the dishes are so bear with me. The inside is actually quite big and nicely laid out. It's really clean and you can see the bar and the kitchen from the seating area, which adds to the ambiance and charm of the restaurant. While we were looking through the menu, we were brought a complementary plate of some type of yogurt sauce, feta cheese and tomato salsa with a pita type bread - which we were not expecting - But apparently that's just what they do! It was delicious. We ordered the chicken kabob and the lamb and beef skewer. Not only did both dishes look magical, but they tasted even better than they looked. The lamb/beef thing was dripping and exploding with flavour. The chicken kabob was chicken breast but somehow it was plump and juicy as well. All of the sides on the dish - The red onions, the cabbage, fresh bread, charred jalapeno and tomatoe and the rice were perfect pairings to the meats. The service here was also really good - friendly and quick. Apparently there is also complimentary tea but I didn't realize this when I declined. I will definitely be back to try more of their menu. This place is expensive but well worth it for special occasions or for when you want to treat yourself!"

You could tell that the restaurant really cared about providing genuine service which proudly represents the warmth and care of the South Indian culture ❤️🫶\nThe food: The food was prepared fresh with good quality ingredients. I read on their menu that they do not use any artificial flavouring or colouring in their food which is always a concern with other restaurants. I’m obsessed with the Punugulu. Their dosas were very crisp which is how we requested it. (You can asked them to prepare it soft) Their podi idli, although the podi is not how I’m used to eating, was good. (Podi preference could be biased since it’s different from how my South Indian bestie’s mom makes it. Which is what I’m used to) Their sambar does not have the typical restaurant taste but a more home cooked taste which is what I like anyways. (They also mentioned on their menu that their recipes have a homemade flavour, hence the homely taste) The food to chutney ratio is very generous. I don’t dip but drown my food with chutney and I still left with a ramekin of their peanut chutney that was left over which my brother eat as soon as I got home. Lol. And he is not a fan of South Indian food so you can tell that their food tastes amazing! The sugarcane juice and mango lassi were very refreshing.\nThe price: We felt like we ate so much but our bill was wayyy less than what we would spend at other places.\nThis is now my go-to spot for South Indian food cravings. One of our servers mentioned that they will soon be opening a location in the West and honestly, it’s high time the West has a restaurant that actually tastes good without all the unnecessary hype!\nPs: The steam rising from the dosas was a testament to their freshness; unfortunately, we devoured our food too quickly for more photos! 😋"

Regrettably, my recent visit to celebrate my birthday was a letdown, marking a notable decline from the high standards I had come to expect here.\n\nTo start, our server's attention was minimal, with scarce check-ins on our table. This lack of attentiveness was a stark contrast to the exemplary service I was accustomed to here. From the moment we were seated at our table we immediately noticed that the restaurant's ambiance has noticeably deteriorated. The once well-maintained setting now shows signs of neglect, with dirty carpets and ripped, uncomfortable seating. This decline in upkeep diminishes the overall dining experience and suggests a need for renovation.\n\nAlso once we received our water we knew something was off-putting. The water cups had an unpleasant odour, reminiscent of a dirty washcloth. Though it was promptly replaced upon request, the experience was disconcerting. Further, the food quality, unfortunately, did not live up to past experiences. The baked garlic shrimp, once served with buttery, fluffy brioche, is now paired with an airy Kaiser bread - a less appealing combination. Additionally, the onion soup was overly salty, lacking the rich flavour balance it previously had. Luckily, the  Calamari and the Pistachio Crusted Salmon paired with vegetables we ordered was satisfactory.\n\nDespite the subpar service, we left a 25% tip. However, the server's indifferent response to this gesture further added to our disappointment.\n\nIn conclusion, while I have fond memories of dining here, this visit was underwhelming. For the price you are paying the service, ambience, and food quality here is not worth it. This location really has declined, and I hope this feedback serves as constructive criticism for improvement. A return to its former standards would be greatly welcomed by regular customers like myself.\n\nkellychan360"

            "text": "I've always loved The Keg; I think it's the best value steakhouse out there. The service is great, and every visit makes you feel right at home.\n\nThis time, to celebrate my boyfriend's birthday, I tried their super cost-effective hidden menu:\nFirst, when making a reservation, note that it's for a birthday or other anniversary celebration. The server will usually ask, \"What's your occasion?\" At that point, you can politely ask if they could bring a complimentary cake for the celebration.\nWhen ordering, tell the server you want the 24oz Omega Prime Rib (not listed on the menu, $63 per serving), and that you want to share it between two people. For the side dish, I highly recommend choosing the Twice Baked Potato, which doesn't cost extra.\nWe also ordered a starter of fried calamari, $19.\n\nHere’s my honest review of this meal:\n🍞The pre-dinner bread was soft and fragrant, with a fluffy texture. Spreading on thick butter made it taste absolutely divine, making it hard to resist eating several pieces.\n🦑Calamari: The freshly fried squid rings were crispy, although a bit small, but the flavor was quite good. The large plate also had red peppers and jalapeños mixed in, along with two dipping sauces, making for a rich and varied taste experience.\n🥩Omega Prime Rib: The steak was enormous, a full 24oz and impressively thick. I ordered it medium rare, which was perfect for me. The steak was so thick it was almost like eating braised beef, with each bite being incredibly satisfying. While prime rib isn't as tender as sirloin or mignon, the parts with tendons were super tasty. Eating such large chunks of meat was truly satisfying!\n🥔Twice Baked Potato: This, in my opinion, is the star dish of the restaurant. As always, it was fantastic!\n🍰Billy Miner Pie: This was the complimentary birthday cake. The cake's main part is coffee ice cream, topped with almond slices, and the base is a chocolate cookie. Even though the cake was quite sweet, it was free, which made it even sweeter in our hearts, and we were especially happy!\n\nConclusion: So, the total before tax and tip was just $82, but it was enough for three people! We were so full we couldn't finish it all, and the leftovers made for another meal the next day!"

My brother had made a reservation so we didn’t have to join the queue.\nThe menu was packed with a gazillion choices, so it took a while for us to decide. In the end, these were what we selected:\n1. Sliced Fish & Pig’s Liver Congee – Very smooth and creamy, the congee had large pieces of both proteins which were well cooked.\n2. Bittergourd with Pork – The default is beef but we asked to switch to pork which we agreed was a great idea as the white meat was fresh and tasty. Only thing is the chefs are rather heavy-handed with the black bean sauce, so we had to order a couple of bowls of plain rice to balance out the saltiness.\n3. Rice Noodles with Beef in Scrambled Egg Sauce – They use narrow rice noodles and the slices of beef were plentiful. What impressed me most was the “wok hei” which was intense, and that made this dish of carbs smothered in eggy gravy, really enjoyable.\n4. Soya Sauce Chicken – It was done perfectly, so even the breast meat was tender. A must-order in my opinion.\n5. Twin Roasted Meat Platter – We loved the roasted duck and “siew yoke” (roasts pork belly). These were executed on point with the former being deeply fragrant, flavourful and juicy, and the latter boasting a super crunchy skin.\n6. Century Egg & Pulled Pork Congee – I liked this even more than the first congee as it had a bolder taste."

Delicately flaky that honestly needs a spotlight of its own, its light buttery taste complimenting the umami of the ham, nuttiness of the swiss, while the arugula completes the bite with a bitter freshness. I can only imagine what the other croissant sandwiches taste like, until I go back, of course."

Those who read my reviews will know that I strive for accuracy and authenticity in my reviews. This one has a few ups and downs. So first thing first, i went woth the rare beef pho. Ive been craving pho since last night so i was pumped to have skme finally. Broth was really good! Not overly salty but very beef flavourful! Busy place, everyone seed to be enjoying their food. So here's where it gets a bit tricky. So while eating, meaning that at first it was not obvious, I found a piece of plastic embedded in my noodles! I had already eaten a few bites and even stirred everything up but didn't notice the plastic until maybe about a quarter way through the meal. So after I told them I was about to leave but they insisted on making me a new bowl and would comp the meal. Usually I don't accept any kind of make ups because I want to remain unbiased in my reviews but this time I accepted as I was stsrving and had to go back to work soon. Second jowl qas ok, broth was still outstanding but the portion seemed smaller than the first, understandable since it was going to be comp anyways. Overall good on the restaurant for giving me a new bowl and for comping it. Bad on them for ha ING the plastic in the first place. Tbh, I'm writing this review after getting back to the office and my stomach isn't feeling the best right now. Not sure if it's related to the pho I just had...in any event not sure if I can recommend this place because of the plastic but you can be your own judge here. Doesn't decent customer service outweigh bad Q amd A? Only you can decide that for yourself. I'm really on the fence if I would return though..."

            "text": "First time here to try out this highly rated pho and banh mi joint. We arrived around 11:30am and it was packed. We had a large group so we waited about 30 min. Not too bad as the line moved fairly quickly. They were known for their banh mi. A note here that you have to order the sandwiches separately at the front where they make them, not from the menu. What I love about the banh mi is the bread. Crunchy on the outside but soft inside, you know the banh mi is on point when their bread is fresh. We also ordered their house pho and the Vietnamese spicy broth pho. The broth of the beef pho is flavorful and they are very generous on the beef slices, for both phos. While the spicy broth was decent but lacking the heat. We also ordered the pancake. It's very different,the egg pancake is crunchy, not soft pancake, with pork shrimp and beansprouts inside. Love the texture actually. We didn't know how to eat this but we think after the fact that you are supposed to do lettuce wraps with the pickled veggies and the pancake. Need to return and try again. Overall I would return to try other items on the menu."
